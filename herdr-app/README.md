# Herdr app

Settings, keybindings and Catppuccin Mocha theme for the Herdr desktop app
(`/Applications/Herdr.app`). This is separate from the terminal UI in
[herdr](../herdr/README.md): the app runs on its own `herdr-core` (`hc`) and
keeps its config in `~/.config/herdr-app/`, not `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`.

## Installation

Install Herdr.app by hand (there is no Homebrew cask), launch it once, then run
`bash herdr-app/install.sh` from the repository root. macOS bootstrap runs it
with every other `*/install.sh`. Existing unlinked files are moved aside as
`<name>.backup.<timestamp>`.

## What is tracked

- `keys.json` is linked into `~/.config/herdr-app/`. On top of the app's
  defaults it adds the Ctrl-Space prefix bindings from the old herdr TUI:
  split (`h`/`v`, Alt-Enter), close pane (`x`, Alt-Esc), zoom (`z`), new and
  rename tab (`c`/`r`), close tab (Ctrl-K), new, rename and close space
  (Shift-C/R/K), plus Alt-arrows for tabs and spaces, Ctrl-Alt-arrows to
  focus panes and Alt-1..9 for tabs. Because the file has been edited, app
  updates no longer add new default shortcuts to it; add them by hand.
- `settings.json` is linked too. It selects the `catppuccin-mocha` theme and
  turns on font ligatures and turns off sounds and pane scrollbars. The app writes through the
  link, so changes made in Settings show up in `git diff`.
- `themes/catppuccin-mocha.json` is generated from
  [palette.sh](../theme/palette.sh) on each install, following the
  [colour rule](../theme/README.md#colour-rule-reference-the-palette-never-hardcode-hex).
  Re-run the installer after a palette change.

Window position, open spaces and mod state stay untracked because the app
rewrites them.

## Sidebar indicators

`install.sh` links `mods/my-spaces/` and generates `layouts/my-main.json`
from the shipped `main` layout with `my-spaces` in place of `spaces`. Pick
the layout once with `herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"my-main"}'` (or
Ctrl-Shift-L).

`my-spaces` is a clone of Herdr's spaces mod. `indicators.js` adds a line under
each space with the same PR and port data the TUI sidebar showed (see
[herdr](../herdr/README.md#herdr-sidebar)): the PR number coloured by CI,
then review, comment, merge and deploy icons, and listening ports on the
right. PR data comes from one `gh api graphql` query every 60s; ports from one
`lsof`/`ss` scan per machine every 5s, so Omen spaces get theirs too. The
clone's `main.js` differs from upstream only in the lines marked
`// indicators` and in fixes marked `// local: <repo>#<n>`.

Local fixes to the clone, such as a backport of an upstream PR that hasn't
shipped yet or a fix for an open issue, go straight into `main.js`. Each hunk
gets one line ending in `// local: herdrdev/herdr-app#<n>`. Keep a backport
byte-identical to the upstream PR apart from that marker. Once a release ships
the marked line verbatim, `herdr-update` drops the marker before merging, so
the hunk merges away. A fix that upstream makes differently shows up as a
normal conflict. Until then `herdr-update` lists the open markers. Current
ones: herdrdev/herdr-app#856 (run at most 6 git checks at once) and
herdrdev/herdr-app#857 (a failed check keeps a space's last git answer, so
worktrees stop un-nesting from their repo on a momentary exec failure).

Worktree grouping is sticky: each space remembers the last repo it was seen
in (lines marked `// sticky`, kept across restarts), so a failed git lookup or
a root space whose terminal left the repo no longer un-nests its worktrees.
Lines marked `// local: <repo>#<n>` are upstream fixes backported early;
`herdr-update` drops them once upstream ships the same line.

The app doesn't hot-reload mods through the symlink. After editing, switch
layouts away and back (`herdr-update --check` does this).

## Updating

`herdr-update` (also run by `aiup`) replaces `hc update`. It updates
herdr-core on this computer and on every connected machine (`hc machine
update`), then reports anything that no longer fits:

- **Upstream spaces mod changed**: three-way merges it into `my-spaces`
  using the snapshot in `upstream/`. A clean merge waits for `--apply`; a
  conflict is written to `mods/my-spaces/main.js.merge` to resolve.
- **Mod API changed**: diffs `herdr.d.ts` against `upstream/` and names the
  changed functions that our mods import.
- **Keys**: bindings to commands the app no longer has, and default
  shortcuts added or changed since `upstream/keys.json` (an edited
  `keys.json` never gets new defaults).
- **Runtime**: `herdr-app check` on each mod, `herdr-app status` errors and
  `*.error` files.

It exits 1 when something needs fixing. `herdr-update --check` only reports.
`herdr-update --apply` writes clean merges and refreshes the `upstream/`
snapshots it accepted. The app updates itself, and its first start after an
update rewrites the shipped mods, so run `herdr-update` again after an app
restart.

## Verification

The app applies edits live. When a file is invalid it keeps the last good
version and writes the reason to `~/.config/herdr-app/keys.error` or
`settings.error`. `ctrl-alt-shift-escape` resets the layout and keys if a
binding locks you out.

## Steps to Configure (OSX) Environment
1. Install Xcode
2. Install Homebrew.
3. `source brew.sh`
3. `source pip.sh`
4. `source bootstrap.sh`
5. Manually symlink nested files to their appropriate locations (I'll add these steps to `bootstrap.sh` eventually).
6. Manually install global npm packages listed in `npm-ls.txt` (hopefully, this can be automated at some point).
7. `source .macos`
8. Restart.

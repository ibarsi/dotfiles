## Steps to Configure (OSX) Environment

1.  Install Xcode
2.  Install Homebrew.
3.  `source brew.sh`
4.  `source pip.sh`
5.  `source bootstrap.sh`
6.  Manually symlink nested files to their appropriate locations (I'll add these steps to `bootstrap.sh` eventually).
7.  Manually install global npm packages listed in `npm-ls.txt` (hopefully, this can be automated at some point).
8.  `source .macos`
9.  Restart.

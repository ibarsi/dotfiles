# Igor's dotfiles

Forked from Mathias Bynens' excellent repo!

https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git

## TODOs

* Bootstrap.sh - Implement symlink creation of files nested in folders (currently only creates links one level deep, in the root).
* node-ls.txt - Manually generated (`npm-store`) _and_ installed list of global npm packages. Would be awesome if this could all be automated.
* .vscode/settings.json - This currently needs to be symlinked to VS Code's machine config location (`~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/`).
* .vscode/extensions.json - Would be nice to find a way to generate this automatically from currently installed extensions.
